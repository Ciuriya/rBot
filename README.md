# rBot

Old discord bot that used to be somewhat relevant but is now pretty much only used as a personal helper bot.

Currently undergoing a complete rewrite!

Features:
- osu! player tracking (posts recent plays)
- osu! tournament reffing (via irc, can be controlled via either irc or discord)
- radio
- custom commands (with limited parsing for things like delays between messages and incrementable counters within commands)

And probably other stuff, I forgot a lot of it, it really just serves as a personal bot at this point.
